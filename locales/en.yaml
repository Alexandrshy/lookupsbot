    I’m a 🤖 that queries registrars for WHOIS info regarding domains.

    In order to get a domain WHOIS you have to simply send a text message with *the domain name*. E.g.: x.com

    Note that there is a *10 lookup requests limit* every 5 minutes.

    I was made at thundersquared.com ⚡️ and I’m open source❤️!
